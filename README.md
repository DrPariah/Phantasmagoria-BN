# Phantasmagoria-BN
An expansive mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights.
### Lore
'With the advent of the Cataclysm, myriad worlds entwined with that of our own. Unusual creatures from abnormal regions of reality congregated to our homeworld. Among the throng of these abominations, the one we have been waiting for arrived. He, whom humanity worshipped since the beginning. The One. The Only. With his arrival, a rejuvenation of Divinity occurred here in our dominion. Dusty relics, once thought to be nothing more than placebo for the poor, demonstrated their holistic powers. Sacred scriptures, which were but fancy words in the past, now came to life. We welcome the descent of God the Almighty. The poets sang of ye; always and forever ye.' 『Notes of a Redeemed Soothsayer』 p. 13, by Skalan Artiska, Monarch of Evernight

'It is currently unknown if the Cataclysm itself caused the Rejuvenation, or if the so-called Incumbent God of Mankind ushered its arrival. The Heraldic cultists deem the Shapeless as the veritable "first cause" of this phenomena, while the Entourage firmly believe that it was the Tribunal; factions within the Entourage itself are conflicted over whether it was the Old Tribunal or the New Tribunal that effectualized the Rejuvenation. The ordinary common folk are just desperate to survive. Whichever be the case, does it not change the fact that humanity is doomed?' 『Damnation』 p. 4, by Sir Linal Naik'Bysij, Baronet.

'God is dead. And we have killed Him.' 『Forgotten Memories』 p. 810, by J. J. Johnson
### Premise
The basic premise of the mod is of everyday, mundane items suddenly having rich history and mystical powers. Like an old Bible gathering dust in a random attic spontaneously becoming sacrosanct, etc. This, however, makes the extraordinary and paranormal extremely common, as you can go to any bookstore in town and grab a Bible to start on your supernatural journey, so bear that in mind.
